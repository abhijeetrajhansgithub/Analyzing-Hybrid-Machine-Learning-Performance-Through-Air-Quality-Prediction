## Methodology

The study follows a structured methodology involving:
- Data preprocessing and Imputation
- Model/algorithm implementation 
    -- BASE
        -- With both PCA and ARIMA
        -- With only PCA
        -- With only ARIMA
        -- With neither PCA nor ARIMA
    -- Hybrid
        -- With both PCA and ARIMA
        -- With only PCA
        -- With only ARIMA
        -- With neither PCA nor ARIMA
- Experimental evaluation
- Result analysis and visualization

## Requirements

The experiments were conducted using:
- Python 3.10
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn


## Limitations

Due to data loss, a small portion of the experimental code could not be recovered.  
However, all final results, visualizations, and the accepted manuscript are preserved. It may also be noted that due to the presence of multiple codes and iterations for each analysis segment, the codes in the repo may have the possibility to not be fully correct. In such cases, please reach out :)


## Reproducibility

While full reproducibility may not be possible due to missing code components,  
the available scripts and datasets can be used to replicate key parts of the analysis.
